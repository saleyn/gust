defmodule FusionPrompt do
  @moduledoc """
  Model Fusion DAG.

  Implements the OpenRouter "Fusion" architecture: a prompt is dispatched to a
  panel of participant models in parallel, a judge model reads every panel
  response and produces a structured analysis (consensus, contradictions,
  partial coverage, unique insights, blind spots), and finally a synthesizer
  model writes the single best answer grounded in that analysis.

      prompt ─┐
              ├─> get_response (map over panel) ─> judge_analysis ─> synthesize
      panel ──┘

  Synthesizing the results of multiple models can significantly outperform what
  any individual model produces on its own.
